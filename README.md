## Introduction
Upon completing the ALX Foundation program, I embarked on a journey to delve deeper into our interactions within the Nigerian Cohort 2 group chat. This analysis aims to uncover insights, patterns, and trends within our communication channel throughout the program.
In this documentation, you will find a detailed project overview, including the objectives, methodology, data analysis techniques employed, and key findings. Also, I will provide some insights into the tools and technologies used, along with the challenges encountered throughout the analysis process.

## Problem Statement
The ALX Nigeria Cohort 2 Group Chat serves as a central hub for communication and collaboration among participants of the ALX Foundation program. With participants from different backgrounds and experiences coming together to learn, grow, and support one another, the group chat represents a rich data source that can offer valuable insights into this project. The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the ALX Nigeria Cohort 2 Group Chat to:
- Gain insights into the patterns and trends of communication among participants.
- Identify key topics and words that dominate discussions within the group.
- Determine peak chatting times and assess overall engagement levels.
- Provide actionable recommendations within the ALX community.

## Methodology 

### Data Collection
The data for this analysis was extracted from the ALX Nigeria Cohort 2 Group, which served as the primary source of communication among participants during the ALX Foundation program. The chat data was exported from the WhatsApp group as a text document for further analysis. see file here 

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
Before analysis, the raw chat data was extensively cleaned and transformed using Power BI Power Query Editor. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, replacing values, removing unwanted columns, removing null values, and standardizing the format of the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### Data Analysis Techniques
Various data analysis techniques were employed to extract insights from the cleaned dataset. Basic and advanced formulas were written in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate metrics such as total chats, peak chatting times, and user activity levels. A date table was created to act as a reference table, providing a list of dates inside within the conversation period. This table allows for smooth data connection and time-based data analysis. 

## Visualization
- *Peak Chatting Time and Most Active Month*: The analysis revealed that the overall peak chatting time occurred at 8:44 PM, indicating a heightened level of activity during this period. January emerged as the month with the highest conversation volume, suggesting increased engagement among participants during this timeframe.

- *User Engagement*: Person 16 and Person 20 were identified as the most engaged participants in the group chat, contributing 682 and 680 comments respectively. This indicates a significant level of interaction and participation from these individuals within the ALX Nigeria Cohort 2 community.
